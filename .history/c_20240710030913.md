**ðŸš€ Join Us in Enhancing CoreRec: A Cutting-Edge Graph-Based Recommendation Engine! ðŸš€**

Hello LinkedIn Community,

We invite developers, data scientists, and researchers to collaborate on **CoreRec**, a state-of-the-art graph-based recommendation engine. CoreRec analyzes and visualizes graph data, offering functionalities for recommending similar nodes, training machine learning models, and visualizing complex network structures.

### What is CoreRec?

CoreRec leverages graph neural networks and advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. It includes:

- **GraphTransformer**: A neural network model using Transformer architecture for processing graph data.
- **GraphDataset**: A custom dataset class for handling graph data.
- **train_model**: A function to train models with custom loss functions.
- **predict**: Functions to predict top-k nodes.
- **draw_graph**: A function to visualize graphs.

### Key Features

- **Graph-based GANs**
- **Graph Attention-based Recommendation**
- **Node Embedding-based Recommendation**
- **Graph-based Transfer Learning**

### Why Collaborate?

- Work on cutting-edge graph analysis tools.
- Contribute to an open-source project.
- Collaborate with like-minded individuals.
