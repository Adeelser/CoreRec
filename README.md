# Usage
### Generating Random Graphs
To generate a random graph, you can use the `generate_random_graph` function:
```python
import vish_graphs as vg

graph_file = vishgraphs.generate_random_graph(10, "random_graph.csv")
```

## CoreRec

```
import core_rec as cs
```
### 1. `recommend_similar_nodes(adj_matrix, node)`

Recommends similar nodes based on cosine similarity scores calculated from the adjacency matrix.

**Use case:** Providing recommendations for nodes based on their similarity within a graph.

### 2. `GraphTransformer(num_layers, d_model, num_heads, d_feedforward, input_dim)`

Defines a Transformer model for graph data with customizable parameters.

**Use case:** Training machine learning models for graph-related tasks, such as node classification or link prediction.

### 3. `GraphDataset(adj_matrix)`

Defines a PyTorch dataset for graph data, allowing easy integration with DataLoader for model training.

**Use case:** Preparing graph data for training machine learning models.

### 4. `train_model(model, data_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs)`

Trains a given model using the provided data loader, loss function, optimizer, and number of epochs.

**Use case:** Training machine learning models for graph-related tasks using graph data.

In the `test.py` file, various functionalities from `vishgraphs.py` and `core_rec.py` are utilized and demonstrated:
- Random graph generation (`generate_random_graph`).
- Identification of top nodes in a graph (`find_top_nodes`).
- Training a Transformer model for graph data (`GraphTransformer`, `GraphDataset`, `train_model`).
- Recommending similar nodes using a trained model (`recommend_similar_nodes`).
- Visualization of a graph in 3D (`draw_graph_3d`).


## vishgraphs
```
import vishgraphs as vg
```
### 1. `generate_random_graph(num_people, file_path="graph_dataset.csv", seed=None)`

This function generates a random graph with a specified number of people and saves the adjacency matrix to a CSV file.

**Use case:** Generating synthetic graph data for testing algorithms or simulations.

### 2. `draw_graph(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)`

Draws a 2D visualization of a graph based on its adjacency matrix, highlighting top nodes if specified.

**Use case:** Visualizing relationships within a graph dataset.

### 3. `find_top_nodes(matrix, num_nodes=10)`

Identifies the top nodes with the greatest number of strong correlations in a graph.

**Use case:** Identifying influential or highly connected nodes in a network.

### 4. `draw_graph_3d(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)`

Creates a 3D visualization of a graph based on its adjacency matrix, with optional highlighting of top nodes.

**Use case:** Visualizing complex network structures in a three-dimensional space.

### 5. `show_bipartite_relationship_with_cosine(adj_matrix)`

Visualizes bipartite relationships in a graph using cosine similarity and community detection algorithms.

**Use case:** Analyzing relationships between different sets of nodes in a bipartite graph.

### 6. `bipartite_matrix_maker(csv_path)`

Reads a CSV file containing a bipartite adjacency matrix and returns it as a list.

**Use case:** Preparing data for analyzing bipartite networks.

### Drawing Graphs
VishGraphs supports drawing graphs in both 2D and 3D:
```python
adj_matrix = vishgraphs.bipartite_matrix_maker(graph_file)
nodes = list(range(len(adj_matrix)))
top_nodes = [0, 1, 2]  # Example top nodes
vishgraphs.draw_graph(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)
```
