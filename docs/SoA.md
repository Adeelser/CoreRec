## Introduction

CoreRec is evolving into a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to offer more modular, scalable, and maintainable services for personalized recommendations. This documentation module provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, deploying, and integrating CoreRec as an SOA.

---

## Service Overview

### Recommendation Service
- **Purpose**: This service is responsible for generating personalized recommendations using CoreRec's advanced graph analysis algorithms.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Generate recommendations based on user profiles and interaction history.
  - Process and analyze data from the graph database.
  - Provide real-time and batch recommendations.

### User Management Service
- **Purpose**: Manages user-related data, including profiles, preferences, and activity history.
- **Key Functions**:
  - CRUD operations for user profiles.
  - Handle user preferences and settings.
  - Track user activity and history for personalized recommendations.

### Data Ingestion Service
- **Purpose**: Collects and preprocesses data from various sources to ensure it's ready for analysis.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Ingest data from multiple sources (e.g., logs, APIs).
  - Clean, transform, and normalize data.
  - Manage data pipelines and schedules.

### Graph Management Service
- **Purpose**: Manages the underlying graph database, including node and edge operations.
- **Key Functions**:
  - CRUD operations on graph nodes and edges.
  - Query the graph for connections and paths.
  - Optimize and maintain graph data structure.

### API Gateway
- **Purpose**: Acts as the entry point for clients, routing requests to the appropriate service while handling security, load balancing, and rate limiting.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Route and load balance incoming requests.
  - Authenticate and authorize requests.
  - Monitor and log request traffic.

---

## Service Interfaces

### REST API Specifications
- **Format**: JSON over HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/recommendations`: Fetch personalized recommendations.
  - `/users`: Manage user profiles and preferences.
  - `/graph`: Interact with the graph database.
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0.

### gRPC Interfaces
- **Format**: Protocol Buffers over HTTP/2.
- **Services**:
  - `RecommendationService`: Provides recommendation functionalities.
  - `UserManagementService`: Handles user-related operations.
  - `GraphManagementService`: Manages graph operations.
- **Methods**: Unary, Streaming.
- **Authentication**: TLS with Mutual Authentication.

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Containerization
- **Tools**: Docker.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Each service runs in its own container.
  - Use multi-stage builds to keep images lightweight.
  - Tag images for version control.

### Orchestration
- **Tools**: Kubernetes.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Deploy services using Helm charts.
  - Utilize Kubernetes' horizontal pod autoscaler for scaling.
  - Implement Kubernetes namespaces for environment separation.

### CI/CD Pipelines
- **Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Automate build, test, and deployment processes.
  - Implement blue-green or canary deployments for updates.
  - Rollback strategies in case of failures.

---

## Scaling and Optimization

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Approach**: Scale services independently based on demand.
- **Tools**: Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).

### Caching Strategies
- **In-Memory Caching**: Use Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data.
- **Edge Caching**: Implement CDNs for content delivery.

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Monitor service health, performance, and uptime.
  - Centralize logs for easy access and analysis.
  - Set up alerts for critical thresholds.

---

## Security and Compliance

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Tools**: OAuth 2.0, JWT.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Secure API Gateway with OAuth 2.0.
  - Regularly update security protocols.

### Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: Encrypt databases and storage volumes.
- **In Transit**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communication between services.

---

## Client Integration

### SDKs and Client Libraries
- **Languages Supported**: Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.
- **Features**:
  - Easy-to-use interfaces for interacting with CoreRec services.
  - Examples and documentation included.

### Backward Compatibility
- **Strategy**: Maintain versioned APIs to ensure older clients continue to work as new features are introduced.
- **Tools**: API Gateway for routing requests to appropriate versions.
